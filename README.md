## Design Decisions

### Form Validation

No request was received detailing form validations; they were designed with arbitrary but reasonable constraints:

- **Campaign Names:** Maximum of 50 characters to keep titles concise yet descriptive.
- **Date Validations:** Years are restricted between 1900 and current year +5, preventing unrealistic future campaigns while accommodating reasonable planning.
- **Numeric Fields:** 
    - Clicks: Minimum 0, maximum 1,000,000.
    - Financials: $0â€“$10,000,000.
    - These constraints prevent data entry errors while supporting most real-world campaign scales.
- **Date Range Validation:** Ensures logical campaign durations by requiring end dates to follow start dates.

### Sorting

To sort by **name**, **profit**, **start date**, or **end date**, click above the respective label.

### BONUS: Responsive Screen
CSS has been added to make it **responsive** and accessible from mobile devices.
